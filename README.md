# ComputerVisionTPs
Notebooks for Computer Vision learning and practice

1. Introduction to basic notions: libraries for CV, image pixels, color channels
2. Introduction to convolution / correlation with filters, padding, some notions in CNNs
3. Edges detection with derivatives (sobel, prewitt, gradient & laplacian of gaussian) and with Canny, line detection with Hough transform, Harris corner detector
4. SIFT applications: find an object in a video, patch a panorama
5. Gaussian pyramids for multi-scale storage of an image
6. Manipulations on binary images: erosion, dilation, closing, opening, skeleton, find boundix box or barycenter of blob
7. Operations in videos: mean shift tracking, background removal
8. JPEG compression algorithm coded with Pytorch
